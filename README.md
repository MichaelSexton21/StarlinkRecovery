# StarlinkRecovery
Reboot Starlink once connection to the internet is lost for 15 minutes.

Over the last couple of years of owning a Starlink system a flaw has emerged. Every couple of months, Starlink will recieve no signal and go into a repeated booting cycle until it is unplugged and rebooted. In an effort to automate this recovery I will use a rasberry pi to control a surge protector to turn off and back on again an outlet that Starlink is plugged into.
